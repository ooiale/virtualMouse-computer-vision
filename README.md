# virtualMouse-computer-vision

This is a  python project that simulates mouse movevments and clicks through your hand movements using a webcam.

Quite annoying to use but could come in handy in a situation where a mouse may not be the best option or absent. 
To make the experience more enjoyable for shaky hand people like me, there is a sensitivity option that makes it so the 
mouse cursor moves less per frame than what your hand really moved so that if you are shaky your shakiness doesn't
affect the cursor's position too much.

This project was made using  mediapipe to detect landmarks on someone's hand.
